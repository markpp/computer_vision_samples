This repository contains small programs and code collection that can be of use when working on computer vision projects in either c++ or python.

## Usage ##

- Clone this repo: `git clone https://bitbucket.org/aauvap/pclchickenorgansegmentation`

**Python samples**

The python samples can be executed by running the scrip with the name of the directory.

- $ `cd computer_vision_samples/python/<sample_project>/`
- $ `python sample_project.py`

**c++ samples**

The c++ samples are compile by using the makefile. In most cases the makefile must first be generated using cmake.

- $ `cd computer_vision_samples/cpp/<sample_project>/`
- $ `mkdir bin/`
- $ `cd bin/`
- $ `cmake ..`
- $ `make`
- $ `./sample_project`

## Dependencies ##
Most of the needed python packages are listed in requirements.txt
