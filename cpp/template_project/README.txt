# pointcloud_evaluator
The program takes the segmented point clouds and matches the label of point to the nearest point in the corresponding annotated point cloud. This results in a confusion matrix that is written to the console.

Instructions:
1. Make sure the segmented point clouds and annotated point clouds are placed in the input dir.
2. Run the compiled program.
